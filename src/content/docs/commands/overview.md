This section documents SteelMC command families that need more than a short syntax list. Each reference explains what an operation changes, which permissions it requires, and how to use it safely.

## Command Index

- [`/perms`](../permissions) — inspect and manage player rules, groups, inheritance, defaults, and metadata

Vanilla commands follow their normal Minecraft syntax. Until a command has Steel-specific behavior that needs its own reference, use the [Minecraft Wiki command list](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands#List_and_summary_of_commands).

## Reading Command Syntax

Command references use angle brackets for values you must provide:

```text
/command <required_value>
```

Do not type the brackets. For example, `/perms group <group> info` becomes:

```text
/perms group moderator info
```

Player target arguments can accept a player name or a compatible Minecraft target selector. Commands that use profile targets can also resolve known offline players.

## Permissions

Most commands derive a permission from their namespaced command ID:

```text
<namespace>.command.<command>
```

Some command families publish more specific permissions for individual operations. The root permission grants those operations unless a more specific rule denies one. Console and RCON bypass player permission checks.

For details about permission keys, groups, contexts, and conflict resolution, see [Permission configuration](../../configuration/permissions).
